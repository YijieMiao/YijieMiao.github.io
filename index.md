### About me
Hello, I'm Yijie Miao, just a lover of mathmatics, a student at Southeast University, School of Mathematics. I am quite interested in Differential Geometry and Geometric Analysis. Specifically, I also enjoy playing Chinese chess, Go, and tennis. Updates on my research and expository papers, discussion of open problems, and other maths-related topics.

### Seminars
* (2025 Summer) [Here](notes/Ricci_flow/Ricci_flow.pdf) are the lecture notes about P.D.E I took when I attended the 2025 Summer School on Differential Geometry.
* (2025 Summer) [Here](notes/Conformal/Conformal.pdf) are the lecture notes about Riemannian Geometry I took when I attended the 2025 Summer School on Differential Geometry.
* (2025 Summer) [Here](notes/Conformal/Conformal.pdf) are the lecture notes about Complex Geometry I took when I attended the 2025 Summer School on Differential Geometry.


### Personal notes
* [Here](notes/some_tools/有限测度当中各种收敛方式之间的关系.pdf) is my note about Several convergence relations in the context of limited measures.
* [Here](notes/some_tools/让你写Tex数学公式提速的妙招.pdf) is some usage methods for LaTeX that I updated.
* [Here](notes/O.D.E/O.D.E.pdf) is the ordinary differential equation notes I took when I was an undergraduate.

### Study Materials
