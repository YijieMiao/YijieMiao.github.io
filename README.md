### About me
Hello, I'm Yijie Miao, just a lover of mathmatics. I am quite interested in Differential Geometry and Geometric Analysis. Specifically, I also enjoy playing Chinese chess, Go, and tennis. Updates on my research and expository papers, discussion of open problems, and other maths-related topics.
### Seminars
* (2022Autumn) [Here](notes/Ricci_flow/Ricci_flow.pdf) are the lecture notes I typed for a seminar about Ricci flow and the sphere theorem.

### Personal notes
* [Here](notes/Foundation_of_analysis/Foundations.pdf) are my notes about the foundations of analysis, which contain some basic knowledge about functional analysis and real analysis.
* (Last updated 2025.09.04) [Here](notes/Riemmanian_geometry(last_update:20230104)/RG_notes.pdf) are my notes about Riemannian geometry (to be continued).
